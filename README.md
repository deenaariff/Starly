# Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews

Our project of analyzing the sentimetn of Yelp Reviews was implemented using Python, various machine learning modules, and a Jupyter notebook.

We also worked on a supplementary project, which is a sentiment prediction dashboard. This was completed using Docker, Node.js, and Python/Flask.

### Install Dependencies

To install all pip module and nltk module dependencies, run the dependencies.sh file.

`sh dependencies.sh`

#### Dependency Versions Used in Our Implementation
pandas: 0.18.1
nltk: 3.2.4
numpy: 1.12.1
scipy: 0.17.0
scikit-learn: 0.17.1
jupyter: 1.0.0

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

Navigate to the jupyter notebook folder from the root directory of the folder.

`cd jupyter-notebook`

Run the jupyter notebook application inside this directory.

`jupyer-notebook`

In the jupyter dashbaord open the file: `Integrated Master File_v8.ipynb`.

### View Jupyter Notebook as HTML

To view a static filed version of our jupyter notebook and its outputs, open `Integrated+Master+File_v8.html` in your browser.

### Yelp Review Predictive Dashboard

Because the predictive dashboard was supplementary, we decided to complete it using Node.js, Python, and Docker.

To run the application, you'll have to have docker and docker-compose installed. If you have a MAC, consider installing docker-machine in order to build the images and run the containers.

To view the instructions on how to run the application, view the `README.md` file in the `prediction-dashboard/` directory.
